docker build -t nginx-node-app:v1 .

docker images | grep nginx

docker run -p 3000:3000 nginx-node-app:v1 -> running instance which we call container

----container----

docker ps

docker stop <cont-id>

----we want multiple instances of this container--- (docker compose)

docker compose up --build -d

docker ps (this shud have 3 instances of your app) -> (verify in localhost:3001, 3002 & 3003)

docker logs <cont id>

---Now instead of accesing each of them alone, we want LB (nginx) to send the request to these apps-----

Terminal - brew install nginx, nginx -V (to locate where nginx.conf is present)

--- check nginx.conf notes ---

nginx -V

after we reload our app is now redirected to localhost:8080

check the nginx access.logs

-----

docker compose down -> stops the containers & server is down but nginx is still running

docker compose up

------------------

we can see localhost request is not secure, we want to achieve that too
so we create our own self signed cetificate using openSSL -IMP

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nginx-selfsigned.key -out nginx-selfsigned.crt

specify the generates certs details in nginx.conf

reload the nginx 

nginx -h
nginx -s stop/reload/reopen

----Thats it------
